A simple rules-based decision engine.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/borfast/decision-engine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/borfast/decision-engine)

You can easily combine comparisons to create rules, which are checked 
sequentially by the engine.

Better documentation and code comments to follow. For now check 
`tests/test_engine.py`.
